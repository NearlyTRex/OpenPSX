README for OpenPSX::DBios

Synopsis: DBios is defined in order to facilitate the decompilation/disassembly of PSX binary images in 
order to understand what environment variables and functions are necessary for a PSX game to execute correctly.

Note: This specific tool for OpenPSX provides NO BIOS for use.  I will NOT distribute any such files as 
part of this project, and even if I were to  have any, and will promptly ignore and/or delete any and all
requests  for such  files.  Please  do  not ask  me for  them.  It  is possible to obtain a BIOS for a 
playstation that you already own, but the details of this process are beyond this document and this project.
If you wish to know how to do something like this, ask around.  You'll probably find someone with an answer.
